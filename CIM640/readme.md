# MIDTERM PROJECT -- PLAY WITH BUBBLES
## INTENTION AND MOTIVATION
Since I saw the videos—Learning p5.js by shiffman that Zeven recommended before, I became more and more curious about programming. It’s really fun to see magic change in just several steps. When I saw those videos, I used to think it’s so easy to mimic and create similar functions. However, it’s a totally different picture when I truly practice. 
In the beginning, I wanted to mimic the sight of a car accident. Nevertheless, I lost my road when I deal with the transfer and rotate parts. It’s too difficult for me to create the function of car’s movement. So I think it’s better for me to mimic the bubbles example shiffman showed in the video. And my motivation is also derived from this example-- https://editor.p5js.org/WestRiverLin/sketches/SJnD_deBW, which is undoubtedly beautiful and impressive. Nonetheless, I was also confused about the part of change object’s color for a long time. In this case, I just did simple mimic. 

## INPUT AND OUTPUT
There are my input and output:
1.	Function mousedragged of mouseX and mouseY—bubbles’ movement like a snack
2.	Function setup loadImage—beackground image
3.	Text—title and instruction
4.	ResetSketch button—button to reset canvas
5.	Keypress—move the bubble by key ”W”, “A”, “S”, “D”
6.	Mousepress—show bubbles and a rectangle
7.	Hitzones—change the color of rectangle when I get close to it by curse

## TARGET AUDIENCE AND PLACE TO DISPLAY 
My target audience is children. I hope they will like those bubbles. And I prefer to put my project in the malls, children could play with bubbles when their moms try on a garment.
